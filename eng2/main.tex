e. 

I'm very different from my good friend, Lev. Lev
is studying to be a surgeon and he lives in his apartment. 
I'm a student too, but I am studying at technical university. I want
to become a unique programmer when I finish.

Дум lives alone in a big flat in
the Velikiy Novgorod, and I live with one neighbour in dorm in the Saint-Peterburg. We often have
parties in our dorm, but Leo does not like this, because he is quite shy.
I'm quite extrovert, so I prefer
being in a group. 

I don't see Lev very often because we
live in different city. But when we're together, we always get on
really well.

\section{story about a family member}

My sister's name is Daria, she is a little over 30 years old, she was born in the same place as me - in Murmansk. I treat her very well.

Dasha always dresses well. She has straight long brown hair, almond-shaped eyes and attractive manicures, probably she is very careful about her appearance.

She works as a businesswoman and I can definitely say that she is hardworking. She has two shy daughters.

My sister is very talkative and friendly, in my opinion she is an extrovert, as she has many friends. We can discuss any topic for a very long time.

Dasha helps one of her daughters to do homework, as she is smart and has 2 higher university degrees.
