Hi, Sally\\
\\
Thanks for your email. I'm looking forward to the trip as it's my first time being an exchange student. I practice English very often, and I hope it will be even more effective when I apply it in real life.
\\ \\
I'm departing from Russia at 12:40 on flight number FR8721 and will arrived in your city on August 28th at 14:10 on flight number FR8722. My contact number is +79958778881. I don't have your number in my phone too, because we are communicating for the first time.
\\ \\
It's great that there will be another exchange student with me. I'd prefer a smaller room, which I can have, as I don't know this person and I'm not ready to share a room with this person. 
I am going to return to Russia by plane that will depart a week after my arrival.
I'm going to visit Buckingham Palace, which is in London, where I can see the Changing of the Guard ceremony.
I'm going to explore The Cotswolds, where I can discover villages known for their unique landscapes.
I'm going to learn about the history of Edinburgh Castle, which is in Scotland, and enjoy the unusual views.
I'm going to visit Stonehenge, a mysterious monument, to guess its secrets.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best wishes
