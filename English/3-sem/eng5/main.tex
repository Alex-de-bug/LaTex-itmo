This is one of my favourite photos. This is a fox decoy. I took this photo in the autumn of 2023 when I was vacationing with friends in St. Petersburg. This place is called the Arctic Museum.

At the Arctic Museum, there is an exhibition about life of northern peoples. For example, here is one of the animals that you can see in the North. In Murmansk, you can often find tracks of this animal. Foxes run very fast and hunt for birds. I love taking photos of various animals, but I don't have a professional camera. Santa Claus...
I took this photo because I found an unusual fox decoy. It's very strange, and I believe, they didn't kill it. In my opinion, it ate expired Kitekat.

I like this photograph, because it was my first successful photo that demonstrates my mood during the session, and this fox reminds me of the cruelty of the North. I have it as the background on my phone.
