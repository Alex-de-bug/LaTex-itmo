Hi. My name is Alex. Well, it's really Alexander but my African friends calls me Alex. I am 19 years old. I am Russian and live in Saint-Petersburg.


I'm going to tell you about myself. I'm at university for programming engineer. I'm studying math, web programming and a little physics. I'm in my second year and I really like it. I live with neighbor in a dorm in the Alpiyskiy alleyway. My parents live in Murmansk.

I have medium-length black hair, green almond shaped eyes. My mother always says I have a mustache in the form of a barcode, but I don't think so. I like a strict style, so I often wear trousers with a belt, white long socks and T-shirts in classic colors. I only wear a tracksuit to the gym or for a run. I don't like bracelets, rings and other accessories.


I think I'm a extrovert. My friends say that  I'm talkative and it's true, I like to meet new people, as I get to know new and new types of character every time.

I don't have much free time because when I'm not in class I have to do homework, home routine and do sports in the gym. But when I can, I like to cook, especially exotic healthy food. When I cook, I watch chefs from different cuisines of the world in english with subtitles.
